# About Me

## Background

I'm Prajjwal Silwal, a Business Data Analyst with a strong foundation in mathematics and a passion for transforming data into actionable business insights. My journey began at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, where I completed 100+ credit hours toward a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. The coursework in Statistics, Linear Algebra, Data Structures, and Business Analytics provided me with the analytical foundation I use daily in my professional work.

Currently, I work as a Data Analyst (Associate – Analytics & Insights) at Cognizant Technology Solutions, where I support decision-making for finance and operations teams through SQL, Power BI, and Python. In this role, I've built end-to-end reporting suites, engineered automated data pipelines, and conducted forecasting analysis that directly impacts business outcomes.

## What I Like to Solve

I'm drawn to problems where data can drive strategic business decisions. My experience spans several key areas:

**Sales Performance & Planning**: I enjoy analyzing sales trends, regional performance, and planning accuracy. My work on sales performance optimization helped improve planning accuracy by 40% and operational efficiency by 20%, showing how the right data infrastructure can transform how teams plan and execute.

**Financial Forecasting & Budgeting**: I specialize in building forecasting models that help leadership make proactive decisions. By developing regression-based models that analyze historical patterns, I've helped improve forecast accuracy by 18%, enabling better budgeting and financial planning.

**Process Optimization & Automation**: There's something satisfying about eliminating manual work through automation. I've engineered SQL and Power Query pipelines that save teams 12 hours per week, freeing them to focus on analysis rather than data wrangling.

**KPI Tracking & Reporting**: I build dashboards that make complex data accessible to stakeholders. By optimizing semantic data models and improving DAX performance, I've reduced dashboard load times by 35%, making reporting scalable and efficient.

## Preferred Industries

I'm particularly interested in roles within:

- **Technology**: Fast-paced environments where data-driven decisions are critical to product and business success
- **Finance**: Organizations where forecasting, budgeting, and financial analysis drive strategic planning
- **Healthcare**: Data analytics applications that can improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency
- **Operations-Heavy Businesses**: Companies where supply chain, logistics, or operational efficiency are key differentiators

## Career Goals

Over the next 1–3 years, I aim to:

1. **Advance as a Business/Data Analyst**: Take on larger, more complex projects that impact strategic business decisions
2. **Deepen Technical Expertise**: Continue building expertise in advanced analytics, machine learning applications, and cloud data platforms (especially Azure, given my experience with Azure Data Lake and Azure SQL Database)
3. **Expand Domain Knowledge**: Gain deeper understanding of specific industries (finance, healthcare, or tech) to become a more valuable strategic partner
4. **Improve Data Storytelling**: Enhance my ability to communicate insights to executive leadership and drive action through compelling data narratives

I'm always open to learning new tools and techniques, and I bring a "willingness to learn" mindset to every project. Whether it's mastering a new visualization tool, exploring a different statistical method, or understanding a new business domain, I'm excited to grow as an analyst and contribute to impactful business outcomes.
