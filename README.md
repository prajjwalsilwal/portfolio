## How to Use This Repo

This portfolio repository demonstrates my approach to data analysis, dashboard development, and predictive modeling. Each project includes:

- **Sample datasets**: Synthetic but realistic data that illustrates the type of data I work with
- **Analysis notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks showing exploratory data analysis and key insights
- **Source code**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling
- **Documentation**: Detailed README files explaining business context, approach, and impact

To explore a project:
1. Navigate to the project folder (e.g., `projects/sales-performance-optimization-dashboard/`)
2. Read the project README for context and methodology
3. Open the Jupyter notebook to see the analysis workflow
4. Review the source code to understand the implementation

**Note**: The datasets in this repository are synthetic/sample data created for demonstration purposes.
